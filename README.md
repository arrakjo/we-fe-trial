# Frontend Trial (Test)

I have built this project with React.js as a test for a Frontend Developer position.

## Backstory

Your employer pays the compensation from the 4th to the 8th day of sick-leave. The Estonian
Health Insurance Fund pays from the 9th day. The compensation rate is 70% of your monthly
gross income.
The maximum duration of one insurance event is 182 days, unless itâ€™s tuberculosis. For
tuberculosis it is up to 240 days.

## Story

As a user, I want to calculate my sick-leave health insurance compensation so that I can
double check my compensation sum.
